# nft-demo

1. We didn't upload an image to IPFS ourselves
(we just used a token URI that was already existing)
2. Why is IPFS decentralized? (preferred solution for storing NFTs metadata)
3. Anyone can mint an NFT here - not verifiably scarce or random
4. We want to actually build an NFT project that has all of these pieces
5. We'll do this project again, but integrating the Chainlink VRF
6. We'll create a new file in our project: AdvancedCollectible
